Thank you for choosing to use Team A's iVote system!

NOTICE: To install system requirements, follow the separate installation documentation provided.

To install system, simply move the root directory "ivote", included in this package, to desired location 
on server that meets system's installation requirements.

**IMPORTANT MySQL DATABASE INFORMATION*************

Included in this package is a .sql file called “ivote_db_schema.sql”. This file contains the system’s db schema, 
and must be loaded into an active MySQL DBMS instance on whatever server you are hosting this system on. 
Depending on what system you’re using to manage your MySQL instance, you should easily be able to import 
this file into your active instance. 

We HIGHLY recommend using an open-source service call PhpMyAdmin to manage your MySQL. However, 
if you do not have any GUI to handle importing this schema, simply copy-paste the text inside 
the file from a text-editor and run in the MySQL Command Line Client.

KEY DATABASE IMPORTANCE

For the system’s MySQL database to work with the current system, you must add a new user to your MySQL 
instance using the exact following credientials:

	MySQL Username:  “iVoteUser”
	MySQL Password: “Bv4PP12L”
	MySQL Hostname: “localhost”

	(DO NOT INCLUDE THE DOUBLE QUOTATIONS MARKS)

If these credentials are applied and still the system does NOT have access to a CONFIRMED working  ivote 
database instance, have a developer look at the “databaseLogic.cs” class and modify the code content from 
lines 41 to 52 to work with your DBMS.



**IMPORTANT FIRST-TIME USER INFORMATION*************

If you have installed the system’s MySQL database correctly, there should be 1 administrative user account 
ready use in the system. The credentials for that account are as follows:

	username:  “admin”
	password: “adminpassword”

	(DO NOT INCLUDE THE DOUBLE QUOTATIONS MARKS)

NOTE: When the system is run for the first time, we strongly suggest immediately changing this account’s 
password, for security purposes, as well as the accounts email address your actual email address.



**IMPORTANT EMAIL FUNCTIONALITY INFORMATION*************

As of late 2011, email is/was being sent from the system via Kenneth Rohlfing’s Arvixe SMTP server. 
However it can only be assumed that at some point in the future Kenneth will discontinue this service. 
At that time, please have a developer access the Emailer.cs file inside the “APP_CODE” directory, 
and change the system’s SMTP information to a new SMTP server you have set up for the system.

That's all folks,

Enjoy!
Team A

P.S. (Please be sure to give the developers in Team A credit if this system’s 
      development is continued by a future team. Thanks a million!)
